        Hi there, my name is Amru Chalabi, I am born here in New Zealand,<br>
        but my parents were born in Iraq. I have an excellent history of <br>assembling working gaming computers, repairing them, etc.<br>
        I was always tech savvy ever since I was a child, and my research <br>and motivation lead me to build gaming computers for myself,<br>
        and 3 other friends. I have also repaired a few. I am hoping to be <br>employed at a company that would accept my talent of computer building.<br>
        If not, I am interested in learning on how to start my own business.<br> I love going to the gym, socialising and hanging out with friends,<br> and I am a very outgoing person.<br> When it comes to focusing on my school grades, <br>I make sure to manage my time wisely to put excellent effort towards that grade.<br>
